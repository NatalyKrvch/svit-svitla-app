# Inventory Management and QR Code Generation Service for Offline Store "Svit Svitla"

## About Us

We are a team of junior specialists who have come together to implement a creative project for an offline lighting devices store and gain experience in teamwork. Our product is currently an MVP, but we already have several ideas for expanding it.

## Project Overview

The Svit Svitla application is an MVP service designed for product inventory management and the generation of QR codes for products. The application allows store managers to create detailed product cards, which include photos, pricing, and specifications. Upon creating a product card, a QR code is automatically generated, which can be printed and attached to the corresponding product. Store customers can scan the QR code to view product information and share it through various messaging platforms.
